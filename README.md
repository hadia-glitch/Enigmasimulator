Authentic Enigma Simulation
Simulates the encryption and decryption process of the classic Enigma machine used during World War II.

Configurable Rotors and Reflector
Choose from multiple rotors and reflector types to customize your encryption setup.

Rotor Stepping Mechanism
Accurately models the rotor stepping and turnover behavior for realistic encryption dynamics.

Plugboard (Steckerbrett) Support
Swap letters before and after the rotor encryption using a customizable plugboard configuration.

Interactive Input and Output
Enter plaintext to receive encrypted ciphertext, or input ciphertext to decrypt with the configured settings.

Detailed State Display
View the current rotor positions and plugboard settings for better understanding of the encryption process
